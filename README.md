# PHASE-1-PROJECT

#### CREATED BY MICHAEL OWITI JR ON 06-07-2023


# PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. (Alternatively use an Array)

Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

## DESCRIPTION

# Challenges
One major challenge faced in this project was using multiple forms in the same html document to utilize fetch requests.It had alot of bugs thus forcing the reduction of forms to one.Apart from the forementioned there is no other known bug.

# JSON Server Instructions
Note: Using json-server is a stretch goal, so make sure you have a working MVP before trying to set up json-server! 

You can use this json-server templateLinks to an external site. to generate your backend code. Using this template will make it easier to deploy your backend later on.

If you prefer, instead of using the template, you can create a db.json file with a structure in the root of your project that looks like this:
